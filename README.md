`PresalePool` is a smart contract for pooling together contributions to invest in an ICO.

It supports the following configuration options:

* minimum contribution threshold applied to each contributor
* maximum contribution limit applied to each contributor
* cap on total contributions from the pool
* whitelist of addresses which are allowed to contribute to the pool

Once deployed, the `PresalePool` contract can be in one of four states: `Open`, `Failed`, `Refund`, or `Paid`

In the `Open` state contributors are able to deposit funds to the pool or withdraw funds from their contributions.

In the `Failed` or `Refund` state contributors can only withdraw their funds from the pool.

In the `Paid` state contributors can withdraw funds which were not included in the pool's overall contribution to the ICO.
After the contract creator sets token contract on `PresalePool`, contributors will able to obtain their tokens.
There is also a method for delivering the tokens to all the pool's contributors which can be invoked by the the contract creator.

The operation to transition to a `Paid` state is `O(1)`. Similarly, the contributor operations (deposit eth, withdraw eth, obtain tokens) are `O(1)`. The operation to deliver tokens to all the pool's contributors is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of contributors. This operation is likely to fail for pools consisting of many contributors because of gas limits.

In some cases editing the contribution limits can be an `O(n)` operation. Adding or removing a whitelist is an `O(n)` operation. Modifying an existing whitelist is an `O(w)` operation where `w` is the sum of additions and deletions on the whitelist.
